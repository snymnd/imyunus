## Overview

Chernival (Chemical Engineering Innovation Festival) 2023 is an annual series of events held by Chemical Engineering ITS. Its goal is to provide a platform for rising generations to improve and contribute to the industrial world at both national and international levels.

I worked as a frontend developer for this project, primarily handling the dashboard for user registration in the Chernival contest event.

## Challenge

This project wasn't a _green field_ — there was an existing project, but we had no access to its codebase. With only screenshots and workflow documentation available, our team decided to rebuild from scratch with a new design and tech stack while maintaining all the original features. Time was a significant constraint: we needed to launch the website within two months with a team of three frontend and two backend developers, all college students in the midst of final exams.

Given these conditions, we held regular sync meetings and worked late nights to accelerate development. Fortunately, our hard work paid off — we delivered the system to the client, who appreciated the new design and confirmed all features were working properly.

## Tech Stack & Tools

**Next.js** → A React framework with extensive utilities that I used to
implement the app's UI.\
**TypeScript** → A JavaScript programming language with
static typing that adds type safety by checking for mismatches at compile time.
This helped identify bugs early and improved the development experience.\
**TailwindCSS** → A CSS framework I used to streamline web styling.\
**Figma** → A design tool used to create the app's interface.

## Features
