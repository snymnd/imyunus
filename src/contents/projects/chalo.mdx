## Overview

You may know or have used [Omegle](https://www.omegle.com/) or [OmeTv](https://ome.tv/). These platforms are known as _random video chat_ apps that let you have video calls with strangers worldwide.

Traditional random video chat apps match users randomly, without considering their interests. However, conversations become more engaging when users connect with people who share their interestsâ€”whether it's hobbies, favorite foods, travel experiences, or other topics. This is where **Chalo** comes in.

Like other random video chat apps, Chalo enables video communication with strangers. The key difference is that Chalo uses a _content-based filtering (CBF)_ recommender system to match users based on their preferences.

I developed this project as my bachelor's degree thesis, serving as the fullstack developer.

## Challenge

As the only developer for my thesis project, I had to handle everything: architecture design, UI implementation, API creation, and deployment. Initially, I thought it would be straightforward.

> It's just a video call app with strangers, what could be so hard about it?

Reality quickly proved otherwise. Technical challenges emerged that made me question my initial assumptions. I went through multiple iterations to find the right tech stack. Bugs became constant companions. Plus, I had to write a comprehensive 69-page thesis report.

Despite these challenges, each obstacle led me to valuable resources and expert advice. Through persistent learning and experimentation, I successfully chose appropriate technologies, implemented complex features, and resolved critical bugs. Ultimately, I delivered a working application, conducted user testing, and presented it to my thesis committee.

| **Bun**                        | A high-performance JavaScript runtime powering the backend. I chose it for its speed advantage over NodeJs and most important is JavaScript.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Elysia**                     | A Bun backend framework (similar to how NodeJs uses Express) that accelerates backend development.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **MongoDB**                    | A NoSQL database storing user data, chosen for its simplicity and suitable free tier.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Flask**                      | A Python web framework used for the recommender system API. I separated the recommender system from the backend since Python is better suited to making a recommender system, and integrating Python programs into a JavaScript environment (my backend) would have been unnecessarily complex. |
| **Cloud Run**                  | Google Cloud's serverless platform hosting the frontend, backend, and recommender system API, eliminating infrastructure management concerns.                                                                                                                                                   |
